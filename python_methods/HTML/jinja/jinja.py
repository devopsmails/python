what is Jinja?
  => helps to produce Dynamic HTML pages.
  => Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. 
  => helps to execute python code by rendering in "{{ #what ever the code mentioned will be executed ex: 5*6 ans: 30 }}"
     Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. 
     Then the template is passed data to render the final document.
