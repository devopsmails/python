Use of Pandas?

1. Super helpful to anlysis the complex form of tabular files.

Pandas is not inbuilt library to make use of it. Need to install it by using a short cut on Pycharm:

"import pandas" > click red bulb symbol > install pandas packages > 

##it installs autometically all the pandas packages.
